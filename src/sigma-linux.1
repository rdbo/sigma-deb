.SH DESCRIPTION
Sigma Linux configuration for Debian

.SH GENERAL INFORMATION
Sigma Linux (Debian) is a preconfigured version of Debian with focus on minimalism and quick workflow. It comes with many different utilities pre-installed, has a live system environment, and can be installed to a storage unit. It makes use of many different programs provided by suckless that have been patched and configured to have a better user experience.

The source code can be acquired from the author's GitHub page (https://github.com/rdbo/sigma-deb), or if you already have the ISO, it comes with the Debian package source code at /usr/local/src/dev.

.IP
.B STATUS BAR MODULES
.IP
Some status bar modules have some default values that might differ from your system's.

- The network interfaces module (sbnwif) searches for a wired connection on eth0 and a wireless connection on wlan0, both without checking for IPv6;

- The battery module only checks the battery BAT1 (check your batteries in /sys/class/power_supply);

To change this values, you either rename the interfaces and battery to match the default value, or recompile dwmblocks-async with the custom values.

To recompile dwmblocks-async with custom values, go to /usr/local/src/dev/dwmblocks-async, modify config.h and run 'make clean install' as root.
